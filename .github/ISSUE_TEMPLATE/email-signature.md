**Guidelines**

***Email signature design dos and don'ts***
- Do keep text elements as text and do not embed any text (other than logo text) as an image. Rather err on the side of simplicity
- Keep email signature width less than 600px. You do not want the signature to stretch the email width necessarily
- The Flow signature is a good example. Logo above and plain text with colour and links below. Logo can go above or below the text

***Email signature design process***
- Design in Photoshop or your favourite design program, including the HTML text that will take on the email software font the client uses. Arial is a good generic choice
- Hand over to a member of the digital team to convert into HTML
- Implement on the client's email using TeamViewer. This can be done by anyone familiar with updating email signatures. Often this requires copying and pasting from HTML into the Outlook signature bar, or Gmail signature area, etc. Each email client is different.
- Consider using embedded images, so the image data is not "hosted" but "embedded" in the email

***Common email signature formats***
- Name
- Designation/job title
- Phone (linked with tel: so that it can be dialled automatically from a phone)
- Email address (linked with mailto: so that it can be opened automatically. Even though you may think it's redundant, it is not, as the signature may be part of a longer thread)
- Physical address
- Postal address
- Company no./VAT No. (saves people asking for it)
- Legal disclaimers
